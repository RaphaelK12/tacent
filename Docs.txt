Tacent is licenced by me (Tristan Grimmer) under the ISC licence. This licence is similar to MIT but without the verbiage.

The various SDKs contain their own licence files in Tacent/Contrib/SDKName
Thank you.

This product includes Radiance software (http://radsite.lbl.gov/) developed by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (http://www.lbl.gov/).
Thank you.
