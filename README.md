# tacent
Tacent is collection of C++ source files designed to be the basis for a game engine or other interactive project. Tacent is being released under the permissive MIT-style ISC licence. Originally the code was the backbone of the Tactile 3D project. 

Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition is being used to compile and run unit tests. Some (selective) improvements to take advantage of C++11 features are being made.
