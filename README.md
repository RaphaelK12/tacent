# Tacent
Tacent is collection of C++ source files designed to be the basis for a game engine or other interactive project. Tacent is being released under the permissive MIT-style ISC licence. Originally the code was the backbone of the Tactile 3D project. 

Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition is being used to compile and run unit tests. Some (selective) improvements to take advantage of C++11 features are being made.

_Browse the Source_

The files that are currently available can be browsed using Woboq, a Clang-based tool that marks-up C++ to web-ready HTML. This tool is being used under the ShareAlike License and the 'What is this' text has been removed. Attribution links remain in tact. Woboq is being run on Windows 10 using the new Linux Subsystem.
