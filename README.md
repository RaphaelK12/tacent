# Tacent
Tacent is collection of C++ source files designed to be the basis for a game engine or other interactive project. Tacent is being released under the permissive MIT-style ISC licence. Originally the code was the backbone of the Tactile 3D project. 

Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition is being used to compile and run unit tests. Some (selective) improvements to take advantage of C++11 features are being made.

__Browse the Source__

The files that are currently available can be browsed using Woboq, a Clang-based tool that marks-up C++ to web-ready HTML. This tool is being used under the ShareAlike License and the 'What is this' text has been removed. Attribution links remain in tact. Woboq is being run on Windows 10 using the new Linux Subsystem.

### Overview

Tacent is divided into a number of separate packages called modules. Each module is a collection of related source files. The code requires a C++11 compiler. Some modules depend on others. The current set of modules is:

* __Foundation__
The base set of classes, functions, and types. Includes container types (lists, arrays, priority queues, ring buffers), a fast memory pool, big integer types, bitfields, units, a string class. Depends on nothing but platform libs.

* __Math__
Vectors, matrices, quaternions, projections, linear algebra, hash functions, random number generation, splines, analytic functions, geometric primitives, mathematical constants, and colour space conversions. Depends on Foundation.

* __System__
File IO, path and file string parsing functions, chunk-based binary format, configuration file parsing, a light task system, a timer class, formatted printing, regular expression parser, a command-line parser with proper separation of concerns, and other utility functions. Depends on Foundation and Math.

* __Image__
Image loading, saving, manipulation, mipmapping, texture generation, and compression to various pixel formats including BC (like dxt1/3/5). Depends on Foundation, Math, and System.

* __Build__
Process launching with captured output and exit codes, dependency rule checking. Depends on Foundation, Math, and System.

* __Scene__
A scene library that can contain cameras, materials, models, splines, skeletons, lights, materials, attributes, and LOD groups. This is not really a full-on scene graph, but rather a tool to allow an exporter to be built and a geometry pipeline to process exported files. Depends on Foundation, Math, and System.


### Design

Tacent source code should be mostly self-documenting. Some C++ interfaces use obscure language features to control the valid ways in which the objects and functions can be used, but the cost is high â€” these interfaces cannot easily be inspected for intended use. In Tacent the goal has been to make the headers easily human-readable.

The implementations in Tacent are intended to be both clean (easily understood) and efficient. Efficient code does not need to be obscure code. Comments in plain English elucidate the complex parts. However, the reader is expected to know the language, so saying a variable is 'const' in a comment is clearly redundant if the const keyword is being used. There is no 'comment litter' in this regard.

This lack of redundancy and clutter just makes it all easier to absorb. You will notice in headers, for example, that a function argument declared as a tList<Item> will not have a dummy variable called 'items' afterwards, as the type already infers it's a list of items.

The dependencies are reasonable and well-understood. The code should be easy to port to a different environment for this reason. For example, if you need a printf function that supports custom types beyond floats, ints, and strings, as well as supporting different output channels, go ahead and take the tPrintf.h and tPrintf.cpp files in the System module and adapt them to your environment and needs. The dependencies on Tacent types and framework are not overbearing.


### Credits and Thanks

Credits are found directly in the code where appropriate. Here is a list of some of the helpful contributors:
* Gregory G. Slabaugh for a paper on Euler angles that was referenced to implement the ExtractRotationEulerXYZ function.
* Robert J. Jenkins Jr. for his hash function circa 1997. See burtleburtle.net

### Notes

The easiest way to see how to use the different modules is to look in the unit tests. There may be more information and comments [on the homepage](http://upperboundsinteractive.com/tacent.php). For example, this is how you'd load a png file and save it to a targa. If the png has transparency, so will the tga:

```C++
tPicture pngPic("ThoseEyes.png");
pngPic.Save("ThoseEyes.tga");
```

And loading a cubemap direct draw surface and saving it to a binary chunk format is done like this:

```C++
tTexture cubemap("Cubemap.dds");
tChunkWriter writer("Cubemap.tac");
cubemap.Save(writer);
```

The image module uses two excellent third party libraries, both with non-restrictive licences. CxImage (zlib licence) is used to load formats other than tga and dds. nVidia's Texture Tools 2 (MIT licence) is used for block texture compression. Since I wanted the downloadable source to just work, both of these libraries are included in the 7-zip download. They have both been upgraded to vs2017. The Tacent UnitTests solution will build both of these libraries.

Regarding the command line parsing code, a powerful feature is separation of concerns. In a typical system the knowledge of all the different command line parameters and options is needed in a single place, often in main() where argc and argv are passed in. These values need to somehow be passed all over the place in a large system. With tCommand you specify which options and parameters you care about only in the cpp file you are working in. A command line takes the form:

```
program.exe [arg1 arg2 arg3 ...]
```

Arguments are separated by spaces. An argument must be enclosed in quotes (single or double) if it has a space in it. Use escape sequences to put either type of quote inside. If you need to specify paths, I suggest using forward slashes, although backslashes will work so long as the filename does not have a single or double quote next. An argument may be an 'option' or 'parameter'.

An option is a combination of a 'flag' specified using a single or double hyphen, and zero or more option arguments. A parameter is just a single string. For example:

```
mycopy.exe -R --overwrite fileA.txt -pat fileB.txt --log log.txt
```

The fileA.txt and fileB.txt in the above example are parameters (assuming overwrite does not take any option arguments). The order in which parameters are specified is important. fileA.txt is the first parameter, and fileB.txt is the second. Options on the other hand can be specified in any order. All options take a specific number (zero or more) of option arguments. If an option takes zero arguments you can only test for its presence (or lack of).

The '--log log.txt' is an option with a single option argument, log.txt. Single character flags specified with a single hyphen may be combined. The -pat in the example expands to -p -a -t. It is suggested not to combine flags when options take arguments as only the last flag would get them.

Variable argument counts are not supported but you may list the same option more than once. Eg. -i filea.txt -i fileb.txt etc is fine. To use the command line class, you start by registering your options and parameters. This is done using the tOption and tParam types to create static objects. After main calls the parse function, your objects get populated appropriately. Here's an example:

```C++
// FileA.cpp:
tParam FromFile(1, "FromFile");			// The 1 means this is the first parameter. The description is optional.
tParam ToFile(2, "ToFile");			// The 2 means this is the second parameter. The description is optional.
tOption("log", 'l', 1, "Specify log file");	// The 1 means there is one option argument to --log or -l.

// FileB.cpp:
tOption ProgramOption('p', 0, "Program mode.");
tOption AllOption('a', "ALL", 0, "Include all widgets.");
tOption TimeOption("time", 't', 0, "Print timestamp.");

// Main.cpp:
tParse(argc, argv);
```

Again, the unit tests, while not offering full coverage, do show examples of this.
